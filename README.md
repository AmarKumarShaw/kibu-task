# Project Title

This is a Next.js project configured to run on port 3002, with a JSON server running on port 3000 for easy database connectivity. This setup provides a complete development environment with minimal setup.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js v14.x or later
- npm or yarn

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

### 1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourprojectname.git
   cd yourprojectname
   ```

### 2. Install dependencies  
   - Using npm:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Or with yarn:
     ```bash
     yarn install
     ```

### 3. Run the Next.js server on port 3002  
   - Using npm:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
   - Or with yarn:
     ```bash
     yarn dev
     ```
   - The server will automatically run on [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002).

### 4. Run JSON Server on port 3000  
   In a separate terminal, run:
   ```bash
   npx json-server --watch db.json --port 3000
   ```
   - This starts a JSON server that serves data from `db.json` at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### 5. Connect the Next.js Application to JSON Server

   Ensure the application correctly connects to the JSON server by verifying the port settings in the code where the API URL is defined (e.g., http://localhost:3000). This will allow seamless data interaction between the front end (Next.js) and JSON Server.

## Additional Information

- **Scripts**: Modify or add scripts in `package.json` if additional functionality is needed.
- **Database**: Update `db.json` to change initial data or add more endpoints for testing.
- **Port Configuration**: The project is configured to default to port 3002 for Next.js and port 3000 for JSON server. These can be changed if necessary.
